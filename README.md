# Welcome to University Of Chicago's _Programming For Analytics_ course
This course introduces programming concepts to students who are preparing to study analytics and data science

Please install the following software

Note Mac users: Once software is downloaded, if you double click to launch it, you may get permission errors. Try to right click on the downloaded software, pick "open" and continue. (Apple is trying to protect you from accidentally starting malware/virus)

## Install Python (anaconda distribution)
Please install Python 3.x from this website: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
(do not install 2.7)

Anaconda's distribution of Python is widely used in the industry, particularly among data scientists. This distribution makes it easy to use many libraries and packages for data analysis, building models, visualization, etc.

#### Aditional steps:
Execute these statements at the terminal (Windows users should use Anaconda Prompt)
  - `jupyter contrib nbextension install --user`
  - `jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user`

## Install Git and Git Bash
Please intall Git, a version control sotware, from this website: https://git-scm.com/downloads (you are ok to use default settings)

Although we don't make heavy use of version control, you will be introduced to the concept. Installing Git also installs "Git Bash," and comand line environment which simulates Unix/Linux. We will do several exercises which will require this environment.

## Install Visual Studio _Code_
Please install Visual Studio _Code_ from website: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Although we will mostly use Jupyter to edit code, VS Code is extremely handy for python developers

#### Additional steps:
Install Python extensions from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python (visit that page and click "Install")
