## Introductory Lectures

### intro_to_consoles
Introduces the console, which may look intimidating and out of place on a modern computer.

### programming_vs_calculator
Starts with a calculator, familiar and easy to understand. Then identifies various parts of it which most of us overlook. Then asks, how can it be expanded into a programming language?

### first_programs
Starts to introduce Python. Shows several complete programs, each introducing new concepts and slightly more complexity

### intro_to_jupyter
A very basic and brief introduction to Jupyter notebooks

### all_of_python_basics
First introduction to much of Python and basic programming language constructs. This material should be enough for students to write basic programs, understand important terminology (to help in searching for answers on the web).

##### all_of_python_variable_assignment_and_tuples
Introduces multiple assignment and tuples

##### all_of_python_basic_functions
Deeper dive into function creation. Also learn about asserts and test first methodology. A short tutorial on using debuggers.

##### all_of_python_numbers
Uses all bsaic operators, including the modulus and power operators. Shows how mod can be used in algorithms.

##### all_of_python_strings
Shows how to use many popular functions and string formatters.

##### all_of_python_basic_plotting
Very basic introduction to plotting. Needed for assignment on random numbers.

##### all_of_python_libraries_random
Students will write this and as a tutorial for others who know random numbers, and basics of python, but not this library.

##### all_of_python_basic_dictionaries
Deeper dive into dictionaries, including .get(,), defaultdict, etc.

##### all_of_python_basic_lists
Much deeper dive into lists. Separate list functions from stack functions.

##### all_of_python_basic_list_comprehensions
Introduces list comprehensions.

##### all_of_python_basic_classes
First introduction to classes so object.method() notation makes sense. Introduce enough inheritence to students get how functionality can be shared (such as measuring accuracy on any scikit-learn model). Introduce how operators are encoded as functions so numpy/pandas don't seem magical.

~~##### all_of_python_loops~~
Introduce the while loop and give extended examples of the for loop. Introduce breaking out of loops, skipping iterations and the else clause.

~~##### all_of_python_more_functions~~
Introduce keyword arguments, optional arguments, notation to pass through arguments. Introduce lambdas and map/reduce/filter functions.

~~##### all_of_python_libraries_filesystem~~

### Intro to Pandas
Introduces the data science library Pandas. It shows how to read csv files, how to view a summary of data, how to explore data using charting libraries, etc.

## Lectures appropriate for second course in programming

### git_version_control
Introduces Git and includes several exercises. This lecture was written for students who have already taken an introductory programming class.

### bigger_data_pandas
Once students are comfortable with Pandas, this course shows how data measuring gigabytes can be handled in Python.

## Miscellaneous lectures

### Data Science in Python
An overview of Python, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn (one hour long)
